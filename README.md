# Takes 2 to Mango : Front-End

This is my capstone project for the BrainStation WebDev bootcamp. 
The isnpiration behind it is that many many tree owners in South 
Florida have excess fruit and it goes to waste. I wanted to build a platform where
mango tree owners in South Florida can connect with people who are looking
to acquire these excess mangos.
